Introduction to ReNomQ
======================
**ReNomQ is a SDK & PythonAPI for developing application for quantum computer.**

Concept
--------
The concept of ReNomQ is to make it easy to simulate quantum computations performed by quantum computers, and to make it easy for users to manipulate quantum computers.

Currently, there are a number of application development frameworks for quantum computers, but many of them require in-depth knowledge of quantum computers in order to use them.

With ReNomQ, you can call quantum gates with python code and easily perform quantum calculations.

In addition, the quantum machine learning API, which applies quantum computation by quantum computer to the field of machine learning, can be used in the same way as existing machine learning API, and computation can be performed.
